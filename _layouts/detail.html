    <p class="vr-copy">This is some more copy specifically about the artwork featured above. Was this piece featured in an exhibition? Is it part of some larger body of work?</p>
    <p class="vr-copy">Then copy about the artist in general, which will stay the same for multiple pieces of work. I think this can be quite rich, with images, links, quotations used where possible - essentially a mini-article. As Alex points out: the more expensive the artwork, the more time we should invest in this.</p>
